# mm-chat Refactor Process Log

Record each completed action here. Keep entries factual: date, action, evidence, decision, next step.

## 2026-07-07 — Initial Refactor Workspace

### Action

Created the isolated `mm-chat/` workspace and generated the first design documents.

### Evidence

Files created:

```text
mm-chat/README.md
mm-chat/docs/architecture/server-refactor-design.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/progress.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/process.md
```

Repository findings used for the plan:

```text
Current app: Next.js/React/TypeScript
Current durable browser metadata: IndexedDB/localforage
Current browser file storage: OPFS
Existing S3/MinIO integration: not found
Target single-server stack: Go + Postgres + Redis + MinIO, optional Python FastAPI RAG
```

### Decision

Use a strangler migration instead of direct rewrite:

```text
Keep frontend stable
Add API boundary
Introduce Go backend
Move conversations/messages to Postgres
Move file bodies to MinIO
Add Redis only for temporary state
Add Python RAG only after core chat is stable
```

All future refactor work should stay under `mm-chat/` until a later task explicitly migrates a specific piece into the existing application.

### Verification

- Confirmed `mm-chat/` did not exist before creation.
- Created planning, progress, and process documents only under `mm-chat/`.
- No existing application source file was intentionally modified for this documentation step.

### Next Step

Review and lock MVP scope, then begin Phase 1 inventory:

```text
mm-chat/docs/inventory/api-routes.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/storage.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/chat-flow.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/provider-flow.md
```

## 2026-07-07 — Initial Documentation Verification

### Action

Ran a lightweight Markdown structure and checklist verification for the new `mm-chat/` documents.

### Evidence

```text
ok: mm-chat markdown structure and completed checklist verified
```

Confirmed tracked scope for this step:

```text
mm-chat/
.trellis/tasks/07-07-mm-chat-server-refactor-design/  # workflow metadata
```

### Decision

Full `pnpm` checks were not run because this step changed documentation only and `node_modules/` is not installed in the workspace. Application source code was not modified by this step.

### Next Step

Start Phase 1 inventory and create:

```text
mm-chat/docs/inventory/api-routes.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/storage.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/chat-flow.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/provider-flow.md
```

## 2026-07-07 — Phase 1 Static Inventory

### Action

Completed the first static inventory pass for existing API routes, service wrappers, local storage, OPFS usage, chat streaming, and provider flow.

### Evidence

Inventory documents created:

```text
mm-chat/docs/inventory/api-routes.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/storage.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/chat-flow.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/provider-flow.md
```

Key findings:

```text
src/app/api/**/route.ts contains 25 current API route files.
src/services/api/chatService.ts owns the browser-side streaming workflow.
src/lib/api/chat-handler.ts owns current provider stream dispatch.
src/lib/providers/base.ts owns OpenAI/Gemini client construction and API-key validation.
src/store/storage/storageConfig.ts defines localStorage and IndexedDB storage keys.
src/utils/opfs.ts owns opfs:// file storage helpers.
```

### Decision

Treat chat streaming as the first backend migration spine. Defer plugins, code execution, document parsing, voice, and full RAG until the server chat path is stable.

### Verification

Static inspection covered:

```text
src/app/api
src/services
src/lib/api/chat-handler.ts
src/lib/providers
src/store/storage
src/utils/opfs.ts
src/store/README.md
src/services/README.md
```

Updated `mm-chat/docs/tracking/progress.md` Phase 1 checklist to mark completed inventory outputs.

### Next Step

Begin Phase 2 by defining `mm-chat/docs/contracts/frontend-api-client.md`, including local/server mode boundaries and feature flags.


## 2026-07-07 — Documentation Directory Reorganization

### Action

Moved `mm-chat` documentation into a categorized `docs/` tree and added category indexes for future work.

### Evidence

New documentation layout:

```text
mm-chat/docs/README.md
mm-chat/docs/architecture/server-refactor-design.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/api-routes.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/storage.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/chat-flow.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/provider-flow.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/progress.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/process.md
mm-chat/docs/contracts/README.md
mm-chat/docs/deployment/README.md
```

### Decision

Keep only the workspace entrypoint at `mm-chat/README.md`. All detailed planning, inventory, contracts, deployment, and tracking docs now live under `mm-chat/docs/`.

### Verification

Updated root README links and progress references to point at the new docs paths.

### Next Step

Start Phase 2 contract work in:

```text
mm-chat/docs/contracts/frontend-api-client.md
```


## 2026-07-07 — Phase 2 Frontend API Client Contract Draft

### Action

Created the first Phase 2 contract for the frontend API client boundary.

### Evidence

New/updated documents:

```text
mm-chat/docs/contracts/frontend-api-client.md
mm-chat/docs/contracts/README.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/progress.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/process.md
```

The contract defines:

```text
ApiMode: local | server
chatApi / fileApi / authApi / settingsApi / providerApi
server endpoint mapping
SSE event envelope and event types
error envelope and error matrix
migration sequence and test requirements
```

### Decision

Keep `local` mode as the default rollback path. Server mode remains opt-in behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MODE=server` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` until Go backend and persistence phases are implemented.

### Verification

Read-only reviewer subagent requested by owner; findings recorded in the next process entry.

### Next Step

Apply accepted reviewer findings before commit.


## 2026-07-07 — Phase 2 Reviewer Findings Applied

### Action

Applied the read-only reviewer findings for the frontend API client contract.

### Evidence

Reviewer found seven issues: provider/model identity ambiguity, incomplete endpoint mapping, undefined DTO/config types, loose attachment boundaries, missing SSE wire examples, weak runtime rollback semantics, and missing `pluginApi` placeholder.

Updated contract areas:

```text
ModelRef providerId/modelId identity
ApiClientConfig definition
MessageOutputBlockDto and MessageVersionDto definitions
message tree/version compatibility fields
runtime config bootstrap via /api/config or /v1/config
strict AttachmentRef source union and source matrix
canonical SSE event/data frames
settings/provider/plugin endpoint mapping
pluginApi placeholder with plugins capability disabled for MVP
```

### Decision

Treat `local` mode as default and require runtime config for safe rollback where possible. Treat plugin execution as deferred, but keep a minimal `pluginApi` boundary so future plugin work does not leak route calls into components.

### Verification

Local validation passed after edits:

```text
ok: Phase 2 contract fixes verified
git diff --check: clean
```

Validated Markdown links, code fence balance, required contract sections, absence of stale `model: string` / `/v1/auth/verify` residues, and Phase 2 progress checkboxes.

### Next Step

Commit and push Phase 2 contract docs.


## 2026-07-07 — Phase 2 Frontend Call-Site Inventory

### Action

Completed the Phase 2 inventory of frontend-facing direct API, storage, and OPFS call sites.

### Evidence

New/updated documents:

```text
mm-chat/docs/inventory/frontend-call-sites.md
mm-chat/docs/inventory/README.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/progress.md
mm-chat/docs/tracking/process.md
```

Inventory sources:

```text
rg "fetch(" src --glob '!src/__tests__/**'
rg "localStorage|localforage|indexedDB|getAppDbStorage|getBrowserLocalStorage|saveToOPFS|resolveOPFSUrl|deleteFromOPFS|writeToOPFS|listOPFSDirectory|opfs://" src --glob '!src/__tests__/**'
rg service imports across src/components src/features src/lib src/store
```

Key findings:

```text
Direct component route calls exist in AccessPasswordPage, ChatApp, ProviderSettings, and DeploymentHealth.
Service-layer fetches are concentrated in src/services/api/* and can become local adapters.
OPFS display and upload paths are spread across chat, media, markdown, workspace, and knowledge UI.
Zustand stores remain the local adapter source of truth for chat/settings/knowledge/memory until server mode is implemented.
```

### Decision

Treat `chatService` wrapping, runtime config/model fetches, and OPFS file adapter extraction as the first code-migration targets. Keep plugin/RAG/doc-parse/voice/code-execution behind disabled or deferred capabilities.

### Verification

Local validation passed:

```text
ok: frontend call-site inventory verified
git diff --check: clean
```

Validated Markdown links, code fence balance, required inventory sections, and Phase 2 progress checkboxes.

### Next Step

Commit and push the Phase 2 call-site inventory, then proceed to Phase 3 Go backend skeleton planning.
