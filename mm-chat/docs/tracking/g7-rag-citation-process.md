# G7 RAG and Citation Process Log

This process log records standalone G7 work. It is intentionally separate from
`standalone-parity-sliced-process.md` so each G7 slice can be replayed without
scanning earlier migration history.

## 2026-07-15 — G7.1 Owner Grill and Cutover Decisions Locked

Objective: start G7 by locking owner decisions before code changes, because
RAG provider, credential, data-egress, citation, and strictness choices change
implementation boundaries.

Owner decisions locked:

- first G7 target is a real provider loop, not fake/local-only;
- all Knowledge data selected for indexing may egress to configured providers in
  this owner-operated deployment;
- provider chain is MinerU + Jina + Postgres:
  - MinerU parses PDFs, including scanned and complex formula/table PDFs;
  - Jina provides 1024-dimensional embeddings and reranking;
  - Postgres owns projection/search state for the first standalone profile;
  - Go owns ACL/source reauthorization and citation minting;
- automatic background indexing uses administrator-owned server secrets from env
  or Docker secrets; admin web key configuration is deferred;
- frontend MinerU BYOK/manual parse paths may remain but are not the credential
  source for G7 automatic indexing;
- uploads/binds auto-enqueue indexing; browser presence is not required;
- retries are capped at three attempts with bounded backoff;
- delete/tombstone is immediately query-invisible; purge is async;
- replacement publishes only after the new version/generation is ready;
- chat queries only collections explicitly selected/enabled in the current chat;
- strict Knowledge refuses unknowns; normal chat may degrade only with explicit
  no-Knowledge-evidence metadata;
- first citation UI is a basic marker/card, not a rich PDF highlighter;
- G7 adds Go-owned routes while `mm-chat` legacy Next `/api/rag/*`,
  `/api/doc-parse/*`, and `/api/chat/rag-queries` remain for G9 deletion;
- provider calls are rate-limited with wide, configurable defaults.

Expected validation for this slice:

```text
cd mm-chat/frontend && corepack pnpm prettier --check \
  ../docs/architecture/g7-rag-citation-cutover-plan.md \
  ../docs/tracking/g7-rag-citation-process.md \
  ../docs/architecture/standalone-parity-sliced-cutover-plan.md \
  ../docs/tracking/progress.md
```

Next slice: G7.2 admin provider config and fail-closed readiness.

## 2026-07-15 — G7.2 Admin Provider Config and Fail-Closed Readiness

Objective: make the G7 MinerU + Jina provider prerequisites visible and
fail-closed before promoting real parser/index dispatch.

Implemented behavior:

- Go backend config now loads administrator-owned RAG provider secrets:
  - `RAG_MINERU_API_TOKEN` with `DEFAULT_MINERU_API_TOKEN` fallback;
  - `RAG_JINA_API_KEY` with `DEFAULT_JINA_API_KEY` fallback;
  - Jina embedding dimensions fixed at `1024`.
- Go exposes protected `GET /v1/rag/provider-status` through the normal session
  identity middleware. The response includes only configured/missing status and
  embedding dimensions; it never serializes secret values.
- Python `rag-worker` settings now accept the same provider secret names and
  fail closed if dispatch enables `parse` without MinerU or
  `passage_embedding` without Jina. `purge` remains credential-free.
- Compose and env templates now pass the provider secret names to `backend` and
  `rag-worker`. Blank values keep G7 provider readiness false and dispatch-safe.

Verification run during the slice:

```text
cd mm-chat/backend && GOCACHE=/tmp/neo-chat-go-build \
  go test ./internal/config ./internal/ragproviders ./internal/httpserver

cd mm-chat/rag && uv run pytest -p no:cacheprovider tests/unit/test_settings.py
```

Result:

```text
Go targeted packages passed.
Python settings tests passed: 25 passed.
```

Next slice: G7.3 provider-backed parser/index profile gate with retry/rate-limit
profile defaults and no provider body/secret logging.

Final G7.2 verification before commit:

```text
cd mm-chat/backend && GOCACHE=/tmp/neo-chat-go-build go test ./...
cd mm-chat/rag && uv run mypy src/mm_chat_rag/settings.py
cd mm-chat/rag && uv run pytest -p no:cacheprovider tests/unit/test_settings.py
cd mm-chat/rag && uv run ruff check src/mm_chat_rag/settings.py tests/unit/test_settings.py
cd mm-chat/frontend && corepack pnpm prettier --check \

  ../docs/deployment/single-server-compose.md \
  ../compose.single-server.yml \
  ../.env.single-server.example
cd mm-chat && git diff --check -- .
```

Final result:

```text
Go backend full package test passed.
Python settings mypy/pytest/ruff passed.
Prettier check passed for changed docs/Compose template.
git diff --check passed for mm-chat scoped diff.
```
